# Any non-empty directory inside a container that is to be persisted must be mapped to a named volume.
# This is because we don't want the empty host directory overwriting a non-empty directory inside the container.
# Named volumes must be removed manually or they will stick around after 'docker stack rm'.
volumes:
  hanelly-data:
  tomcat-conf:
  # need more here for JVM working dirs for all containers that have them in order to persist JVM heap dumps...
  # though Khosrow questioned the value of this
