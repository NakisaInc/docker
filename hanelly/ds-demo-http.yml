# Must declare a named volume which is mapped to Hanelly container directory
# this is because the container directory is not empty and we don't want the host directory to overwrite it.
# named volumes must be removed manually or they will stick around after 'docker stack rm'
volumes:
  hanelly-data:
  # need more here for JVM working dirs for all containers that have them...
  # but need to also understand named volume cleanup very well before we go creating tons of named volumes that stick around
